# Amazon UI clone
 This project is a clone of the Amazon websiteâ€™s user interface, designed to emulate the look and feel of Amazon's front-end. It replicates key pages, like the home page, product listing, product detail pages, and shopping cart. The project is built with modern web technologies, such as React, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and utilizes Redux or Context API for state management. This clone aims to give developers hands-on experience with responsive UI design, component-based architecture, and implementing features like search, filters, and authentication (if included).
